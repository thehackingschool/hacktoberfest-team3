FYI By Team HacktoByte.

Sometimes it’s nice to have just a few words interaction rather than a lengthy conversation. 
Essentially, FYI is the same as a Poke, but with a much more ambiguous purpose. FYI allows users to send a message to a friend without having to go through the tedious process of crafting coherent sentences. 
It's a unique feature that allows you to send a notification to someone. If you haven’t talked to someone in a while, you can just FYI them as an icebreaker, and can use it to send a greeting to someone or even a Rush-Message!                                                                                             
It’s meant to be a very brief form of communication and it’s equivalent to a tap on the shoulder.
